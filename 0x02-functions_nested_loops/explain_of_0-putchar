In the main source file (main.c), the _putchar function is called inside a for loop for each character of the str[] array.

The for loop iterates from 0 to 7 (since ch starts from 0 and goes up to < 8). This means it will iterate through each character of the str[] array.

Inside the loop, _putchar(str[ch]) is called, passing each character from the str[] array as an argument to the _putchar function.

The _putchar function is defined in the _putchar.c file. It takes a character as an argument and returns an integer.

In the _putchar function definition, putchar(ch) is called. The putchar function is part of the standard library and is responsible for printing a character to the standard output.

The character passed as an argument to putchar(ch) will be printed to the standard output (e.g., the console).

The putchar function returns an integer value that represents the character that was printed.

This returned value from putchar(ch) is then returned by the _putchar function.

In the main source file, the returned value from _putchar(str[ch]) is not explicitly used. It is simply called within the loop for each character, printing them one by one.

After the loop, _putchar('\n') is called to print a newline character, which creates a line break.

Finally, the main function returns 0, indicating successful program execution.

So, in summary, the _putchar function is called within the loop to print each character from the str[] array using the putchar function. The returned value from _putchar is not used directly in this specific example, but the effect is that the characters are printed to the standard output one by one.
